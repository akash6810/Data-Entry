ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm working on Javascript projects nowadaysðŸ˜ƒ. I learned how to handle a database using local storage.
I've used localstorage to store all of the data for this straightforward data entry project. I picked up handling the local storage here.

ðŸŒŸAdditionally, I created two buttons for editing and deleting.
